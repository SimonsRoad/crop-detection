# Symmetry-Based Plant Detection in 3D Point Clouds from Crop Fields

This repository contains code to reproduce the experiments conducted in the paper "Symmetry-Based Plant Detection in 3D Point Clouds from Crop Fields"

## Reproduction of paper results
The script `evaluation.m` will generate all figures from section III Experiments.
These can be accessed in the pane to the right.

## Visualize algorithm results
The script `example.m` can be used to explore the results in an interactive way inside a Matlab figure window.
Note that the example script cannot be run inside codeocean.
